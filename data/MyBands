VMounted models ride some sort of steed -- be it a horse, a giant turtle, a bear or other riding creature. Mounted figures have +1 on their Combat score in melee versus any non-Mounted figure their size or smaller. This means that the Mounted bonus does not work against opponents who are one or more sized bigger (example: normal Mounted creature vs Big or Huge creature). Mounted figures have the Free Disengage rule against all non-Mounted, non-Flying enemies. To keep things simple, rider and mount are treated as a single figure for purposes of the game. You don\u2019t need a separate model for the mount without its rider: it is assumed to run away or be out of action when the rider is killed. Mounted models may \u201cpick up\u201d and transport friendly models of the same size of their riders or smaller. It takes one action for a Mounted model who is adjacent to a foot figure (of the same size or smaller) to pick up a friend. The carried figure does not need to be activated to be carried - a fast cavalryman could pick up a panicking child and bring him to safety, for example. This also applies to a Transfixed model. Only one creature may be carried. A carried figure may later dismount. It takes one action on the part of the carried figure to dismount: place the carried figure anywhere adjacent to the mount\u2019s base when he does so. The movement of Mounted models is reduced for rough terrain as normal for any figure.

Anytime the model is beaten in Combat by one point, the model does not Recoil or Fall \u2014 the armor turns the opponent\u2019s blow and the Combat round is a draw.
