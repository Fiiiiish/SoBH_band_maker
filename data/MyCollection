VMounted models ride some sort of steed -- be it a horse, a giant turtle, a bear or other riding creature. Mounted figures have +1 on their Combat score in melee versus any non-Mounted figure their size or smaller. This means that the Mounted bonus does not work against opponents who are one or more sized bigger (example: normal Mounted creature vs Big or Huge creature). Mounted figures have the Free Disengage rule against all non-Mounted, non-Flying enemies. To keep things simple, rider and mount are treated as a single figure for purposes of the game. You don\u2019t need a separate model for the mount without its rider: it is assumed to run away or be out of action when the rider is killed. Mounted models may \u201cpick up\u201d and transport friendly models of the same size of their riders or smaller. It takes one action for a Mounted model who is adjacent to a foot figure (of the same size or smaller) to pick up a friend. The carried figure does not need to be activated to be carried - a fast cavalryman could pick up a panicking child and bring him to safety, for example. This also applies to a Transfixed model. Only one creature may be carried. A carried figure may later dismount. It takes one action on the part of the carried figure to dismount: place the carried figure anywhere adjacent to the mount\u2019s base when he does so. The movement of Mounted models is reduced for rough terrain as normal for any figure.

VModels with the Long Move rule use the Long measuring stick when moving. Note that it is possible to have a Slow character with Long move \u2013 an example would be a giant with very long legs but slow reflexes. He doesn't react fast but when he moves, he can outrun a man with just one stride.

VThis rule represents protection offered by a complete suit of armor or a dragon\u2019s scales. Anytime the model is beaten in Combat by one point, the model does not Recoil or Fall \u2014 the armor turns the opponent\u2019s blow and the Combat round is a draw. A model wearing Heavy Armor may not benefit from the Stealth rule and has -2 on climbing rolls.

VBig creatures (ogres, trolls, minotaurs, and the like) have +1 in melee versus smaller folk, but are targeted at +1 by ranged attacks. See Huge and Gargantuan for even bigger models. The Big rule represents not only size but also the increased physical strength which usually comes with large mass. To represent a large but weak fighter, give him Big but also lower his Combat score by 1. The end result is a figure which is easier to hit with missiles and isn\u2019t particularly strong in melee.

VTough models are hard to kill. When a Tough model receives a Gruesome Death, it is treated as a normal kill -- the model dies but there is no Morale effect. When it receives a normal kill result, the model is just wounded -- the model is not removed but its Quality target roll goes up by one. For example, when a Dragon with Quality 3+ is killed, it stays alive and becomes a Quality 4+ model. When Quality becomes 7+, the model dies. As reminders of a model\u2019s wounds, you can use wound markers shaped like drops of blood or red plastic rings that you can put on the model. Note that a Tough model does not fall when he is doubled by the opponent. When a Tough model is already fallen and receives the killing blow, his quality goes up by 1 but he STAYS down: he still has to spend one action to stand up when his turn comes. If enemies gang up on the fallen tough character, they can keep beating him and reduce his Quality more than once in the same turn. When a Tough model flees due to a failed morale test and moves into the intercept area of an active opponent (that is, 1 x Short distance from any active opponent), the model is not killed, but takes one wound as explained above. The model\u2019s movement stops and the enemy that caused the wound is moved in melee contact with him. Note that this is optional: the intercepting model may decide it is better to let flee the Tough model. If this happens, the intercepting model is NOT moved in contact and the fleeing Tough model does NOT take a wound. Tough models heal any Quality loss between scenarios.

VA Savage model inflicts a gruesome kill just by doubling the opponent\u2019s score in melee (i.e. they don\u2019t need to treble it -- every kill counts as gruesome). All friends of the savagely-killed model in LOS and within 1 x Medium range must test Morale. Note that the effects of Savage do not apply to ranged attacks.
